                </header>
                <p>As co-founder of Hanfgrün.de, I was successfully involved since November 2019 in selling high-quality
                    CBD in various forms such as oils, capsules, creams, and teas, promoting a healthy lifestyle for
                    people of all ages. In addition, I was responsible for conducting comprehensive market research
                    analyses, providing valuable insights into the market and making informed decisions. In my role as a
                    co-founder, I was also responsible for developing new products. In our laboratory, I created my own
                    CBD-based skin creams, which have been highly popular. We worked hard to establish our business
                    successfully in the market, focusing on quality and customer satisfaction. My experience as a
                    co-founder of Hanfgrün.de has given me valuable skills in business start-up, product development,
                    marketing, sales, and customer service. I am proud to be involved in creating a company that has a
                    positive impact on people's lives and look forward to continuing to contribute to making Hanfgrün.de
                    a leading provider of high-quality CBD.

                    <p><b>February 2020 - March 2021</b></p>
                </header>
                <p>As a co-founder of Lvly-menu.com, also known as Lovly Menu, I had the privilege of participating in a
                    significant project from February 2020 to March 2021. We developed the first digital menu in Germany
                    for the COVID-19 pandemic, which allowed guests to record their contact information through a QR
                    code and comply with COVID-19 guidelines. Additionally, it enabled our partners to display targeted
                    advertising, which was a win-win situation for both our customers and partners. During my
                    involvement with Lovly Menu, we worked closely with sponsors such as Schweppes, Campari, Brown &
                    Formers - Jack Daniels, Holiday in Hotels, and other companies to expand our reach and improve our
                    distribution opportunities. This collaboration allowed us to make a free contribution to support the
                    gastronomy industry and offer our customers a better experience. My responsibilities for this
                    project included engaging in conversations with various spirit companies (brands), which I could
                    leverage my contacts from my own business with PHYNE Restaurant & Bar. Additionally, I was one of
                    the creative minds behind this idea that we worked on with our team. My experiences as a co-founder
                    at Lovly Menu have strengthened my skills in project management, business development, and
                    collaboration with sponsors and partners. I am proud to have been a part of this project and look
                    forward to applying my experiences and skills in future endeavors.

                <p>As the founder and owner of PHYNE Restaurant and Bar in Cologne, it was my responsibility to develop
                    and execute the concept and vision of the business. From January 2017 to December 2019, I played a

                    experience and a unique entertainment experience. In my role as owner, I was responsible for
                    creating the food and cocktail menus, which I personally wrote and designed. Additionally, I was in
                    charge of organizing live music performances and managing the sound system. I worked closely with
                    our team to ensure that the service was always of the highest quality and that all guests were
                    satisfied with an unforgettable experience. My experience as the founder and owner of PHYNE
                    Restaurant and Bar has provided me with valuable skills and knowledge in areas such as business
                    management, marketing, customer service, and event organization. I am proud to have built a
                    successful business and look forward to applying my experiences and skills to future professional
                    challenges.
